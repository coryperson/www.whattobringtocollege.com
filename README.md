This website was built as a guide for incoming college freshman to learn what they need to pack for life in college dormitories.

It has existed under several different names over the years, but its unique visitor count totals in the hundreds of thousands.

Built using Bootstrap. Monetized using Google AdSense and Amazon Associates.

It has since been replaced with a more modern look using WordPress as a platform.
